            <p>This year for State of the Map we look at the last
            six years of OpenStreetMap's growth and change.</p>
            <p>Founded in 2005, OpenStreetMap has grown from a local
            project to a worldwide map with widespread use and
            high data quality.</p>

                  <p>
                  On January 6, 2013, OpenStreetMap crossed
                  the 1 million users mark, and continued to grow, both
                  in terms of data and active userbase.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  Like most internet projects, a majority of users
                  are casual or inactive, with a small minority contributing
                  the majority of additions and corrections to the map.

                  <p>
                  OpenStreetMap's database, called the 'Planet', has
                  grown tremendously over time, as well as other forms of
                  user-contributed data, like GPX tracks from GPS devices.

                  <h2>Regions</h2>
                  <p>
                  Many variables affect how active OpenStreetMap users are
                  in each region. Some areas are quickly, exhaustively
                  mapped after natural disasters, while others have committed
                  groups of local enthusiasts.
                  </p>

                  <p>The early OpenStreetMap project was focused on the United
                  Kingdom, with most of the rest of the data in a few places
                  in Europe. The map is comparatively tiny in North America,
                  except for some areas of detail in Wisconsin and around the
                  Chesapeake Bay. The relative prominence of Antarctica shows
                  how little map data there was for most parts of the world.</p>

                  <p>Although active mapping continued in Europe, and other
                  areas of the world began to be filled in, the OpenStreetMap
                  globe was massively reshaped in late 2007 and early 2008 by
                  the months-long import of the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER/Line
                  map data for the United States.</p>

                  <p>With the United States map filled in, the bulk of mapping
                  activity moved back to Europe, where by mid-2009, the
                  work put into mapping Germany made it visually dominate the cartogram.</p>

                  <p>2010 and 2011 saw great increases in mapping in Canada,
                  France, and Japan, as well as continued additions and
                  corrections in large US cities.</p>

                  <p>The most recent available OSM history file, from February,
                  2013, shows some recent mapping in New Zealand, and that the
                  map in Canada and Russia has continued to improve. It also
                  highlights, though, how disproportionately well mapped Europe
                  and the United States continue to be compared to the rest
                  of the world, in spite of some recent work in Africa
                  and South America.</p>

              The explosive growth of OpenStreetMap has required multiple
              large reinventions: rewriting and redacting history, introducing
              new, better APIs, and more.

                  In Chicago, Ian Dees led an import of building data
                  from the city government that both improved addressing
                  to locations in the city and made the map more useful.

                  The <code>bot-mode</code> automated editor swept of the
