        <h1>OpenStreetMap Data Report</h1>
        <p>This year for State of the Map we look at the last
        six years of OpenStreetMap's growth and change.</p>

              <h2>Intercontinental Change</h2>
              <p>OpenStreetMap has grown from a relatively UK-focused project
              into an international collaboration with many connected communities,
              all working to improve the map. This rendering shows data growth
              as country size, revealing imports and the impact of collaborative
              editing as bulging change.</p>

          <div class='col5 pad1 cartogram-notes'>
            <p>The early OpenStreetMap project was focused on the United Kingdom, with most of the rest of the data in a few places in Europe. The map is comparatively tiny in North America, except for some areas of detail in Wisconsin and around the Chesapeake Bay. The relative prominence of Antarctica shows how little map data there was for most parts of the world.</p>
            <p>Although active mapping continued in Europe, and other areas of the world began to be filled in, the OpenStreetMap globe was massively reshaped in late 2007 and early 2008 by the months-long import of the U.S. Census Bureau's TIGER/Line map data for the United States.</p>
            <p>With the United States map filled in, the bulk of mapping activity moved back to Europe, where by mid-2009, the work put into mapping Germany made it visually dominate the cartogram.</p>
            <p>2010 and 2011 saw great increases in mapping in Canada, France, and Japan, as well as continued additions and corrections in large US cities.</p>
            <p>The most recent available OSM history file, from February, 2013, shows some recent mapping in New Zealand, and that the map in Canada and Russia has continued to improve. It also highlights, though, how disproportionately well mapped Europe and the United States continue to be compared to the rest of the world, in spite of some recent work in Africa and South America.</p>

            <p>OpenStreetMap boasts more than a million members, with a subset
            of those having contributed and an even smaller subset contributing
            the majority of data.</p>
